Triton Model Navigator
========================

Welcome to the `Triton Model Navigator`_, an inference toolkit designed
for optimizing and deploying Deep Learning models with a focus on NVIDIA GPUs. The Triton Model Navigator streamlines the
process of moving models and pipelines implemented in `PyTorch`_, `TensorFlow`_, and `ONNX`_ to `TensorRT`_.

The Triton Model Navigator automates several critical steps, including model export, conversion, correctness testing, and
profiling. By providing a single entry point for various supported frameworks, users can efficiently search for the best
deployment option using the per-framework optimize function. The resulting optimized models are ready for deployment on
either `PyTriton`_ or `Triton Inference Server`_.

Prerequisites
---------------

Before proceeding with the installation of the Triton Model Navigator, ensure your system meets the following criteria:

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- **Python**: Version `3.8` or newer
- NVIDIA GPU

You can use NGC Containers for PyTorch and TensorFlow which contain all necessary dependencies:

- `PyTorch container`_
- `TensorFlow container`_

Install
---------

The Triton Model Navigator can be installed from `pypi.org` by running the following command:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[<extras,>]

Installing with PyTorch extras:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[torch]

Installing with TensorFlow extras:

.. code-block:: text

    pip install -U --extra-index-url https://pypi.ngc.nvidia.com triton-model-navigator[tensorflow]

Optimize Stable Diffusion with Inplace
----------------------------------------

The Inplace Optimize allows seamless optimization of models for deployment, such as converting
them to TensorRT, without requiring any changes to the original Python pipelines.

For the Stable Diffusion model, initialize the pipeline and wrap the model components with `nav.Module`:

.. code-block:: python

    import model_navigator as nav
    from transformers.modeling_outputs import BaseModelOutputWithPooling
    from diffusers import DPMSolverMultistepScheduler, StableDiffusionPipeline


    def get_pipeline():
        # Initialize Stable Diffusion pipeline and wrap modules for optimization
        pipe = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1")
        pipe.scheduler = DPMSolverMultistepScheduler.from_config(pipe.scheduler.config)
        pipe = pipe.to("cuda")

        pipe.text_encoder = nav.Module(
            pipe.text_encoder,
            name="clip",
            output_mapping=lambda output: BaseModelOutputWithPooling(**output),
        )
        pipe.unet = nav.Module(
            pipe.unet,
            name="unet",
        )
        pipe.vae.decoder = nav.Module(
            pipe.vae.decoder,
            name="vae",
        )

        return pipe

Prepare a simple dataloader:

.. code-block:: python

    def get_dataloader():
        # Please mind, the first element in tuple need to be a batch size
        return [(1, "a photo of an astronaut riding a horse on mars")]

Execute model optimization:

.. code-block:: python

    pipe = get_pipeline()
    dataloader = get_dataloader()

    nav.optimize(pipe, dataloader)

Once the pipeline has been optimized, you can load explicit the most performant version of the modules executing:

.. code-block:: python

    nav.load_optimized()

After executing this method, when the optimized version of module exists, it will be used in your pipeline execution
directly in Python. The example how to serve Stable Diffusion pipeline through PyTriton can be
found `here`_.

Optimize ResNET and deploy on Triton
--------------------------------------

The Triton Model Navigator also supports an optimization path for deployment on Triton. This path is supported for nn.Module,
keras.Model or ONNX files which inputs are tensors.


To optimize ResNet50 model from TorchHub run the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import torch
    import model_navigator as nav

    # Optimize Torch model loaded from TorchHub
    package = nav.torch.optimize(
        model=torch.hub.load('NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples:torchhub', 'nvidia_resnet50', pretrained=True).eval(),
        dataloader=[torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256) for _ in range(10)],
    )


Once optimization is done, creating a model store for deployment on Triton is simple as following code:

.. code-block:: python

    import pathlib

    # Generate the model store from optimized model
    nav.triton.model_repository.add_model_from_package(
        model_repository_path=pathlib.Path("model_repository"),
        model_name="resnet50",
        package=package,
        strategy=nav.MaxThroughputStrategy(),
    )

Profile any model or callable in Python
-----------------------------------------

The Triton Model Navigator enhances models and pipelines and provides a uniform method for profiling any Python
function, callable, or model. At present, our support is limited strictly to static batch profiling scenarios.

As an example, we will use a simple function that simply sleeps for 50 ms:

.. code-block:: python

    import time


    def custom_fn(input_):
        # wait 50ms
        time.sleep(0.05)
        return input_

Let's provide a dataloader we will use for profiling:

.. code-block:: python

    # Tuple of batch size and data sample
    dataloader = [(1, ["This is example input"])]

Finally, run the profiling of the function with prepared dataloader:

.. code-block:: python

    nav.profile(custom_fn, dataloader)

We offer comprehensive, step-by-step `guides`_ that showcase the utilization of the Triton Model Navigatorâ€™s diverse
features. These
guides are designed to elucidate the processes of optimization, profiling, testing, and deployment of models using
`PyTriton`_ and `Triton Inference Server`_.
